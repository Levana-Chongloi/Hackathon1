Snack Smash

I think you have a real touch in web design! 
I like the styling of this and the idea itself is a real mood lifter !

The code itself:
It looks like you have a lot of capabilities with html and css.
One thing I would add styling wise is responsivness. If someone opens this with their phone it simply does
not work.
In the past weeks before the hackathon you learnt functions, loops, conditionals & dom manipulation. 
I would like to see more of this in your future projects because this is not enough javascript.
Good job !
